# Unity-AOP-proof
I'm validating [H1M4W4R1](https://github.com/H1M4W4R1/) AOP project (https://github.com/H1M4W4R1/Unity-Aspect-Oriented-Programming/) with a non-intrusive profiling module.

The original project was taken from the description of this Unity video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qeNu2QApAM&ab_channel=Unity,
so then, I added [H1M4W4R1](https://github.com/H1M4W4R1/) repo as a submodule.

The code I added is under [Assets/Scripts/Profiling](Assets/Scripts/Profiling). Also, I had to add the corresponding created attributes in [Assets/Scripts/Game/Movement.cs](Assets/Scripts/Game/Movement.cs) and [Assets/Scripts/Game/ParticleCollision.cs](Assets/Scripts/Game/ParticleCollision.cs).
